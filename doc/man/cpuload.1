.SH NAME
cpuload \- generates CPU load
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcpuload\fP [-s <id> | -p ] target-load-percentage
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fICpuload\fP is a small tool that can be used to generate an adjustable
amount of CPU load. It also provides control over its own priority and scheduler policy without having to resort into use of additional tools.
.PP
Please note that the actual amount of load generated will not exactly
match the requested value. The difference between requested and actual
measured value should be somewhere between 5-9%. When using value of 0
for the load percentage, a random CPU load will be generated. The load
will be generated by alternating between very short periods of a running
busy loop and idling with nanosleep.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -s \fI<id>\fP
Modifies scheduling priority and policy for the cpuload process. Valid id values include currently:
.RS 7
.TP
.B 
l
Sets lowest possible priority for this process.
.TP
.B
h
Sets the highest possible priority for this process. Needs superuser priviledges.
.TP
.B
b
Sets this process to be scheduled with the batch scheduler.
.TP
.B
f
Sets this process to be scheduled with the fifo scheduler. Needs superuser priviledges.
.TP
.B
r
Sets this process to be scheduled with round-robin scheduler. Needs superuser priviledges.
.TP
.B
o
Sets this process to be scheduled with the default Linux time-sharing scheduler. 
.RE
.TP
.B \-p
Legacy option, has effectively the same effect as '-s h', i.e. sets highest available priority.
