.SH NAME
cpuload \- generates CPU load
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcpuload\fP target-load-percentage
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fICpuload\fP is a small tool that can be used to generate an adjustable
amount of CPU load.
.PP
Please note that the actual amount of load generated will not exactly
match the requested value. The difference between requested and actual
measured value should be somewhere between 5-9%. When using value of 0
for the load percentage, a random CPU load will be generated. The load
will be generated by alternating between very short periods of a running
busy loop and idling with nanosleep.
.SH OPTIONS
Currently, the tool does not have actual options. It only expects the
target load percentage as an argument, as described above.
